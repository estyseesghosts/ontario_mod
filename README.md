just a simple minecraft building mod, adds some vanilla-ish blocks for some flair, still a WIP 
currently for 1.19.4...

blocks added:
+ bookshelves for every kind of planks (including cherry and bamboo)
+ bricks and tiled variants of andesite, diorite and granite
+ stairs and slab variants of the tiled stones
+ calcite bricks
+ quartz tiles
+ calcite checkerboard tiles 

TODO:
- workbench (scaffold shaped-and-modeled crafting table) 
- fake bedrock (is implemented but i need to finish the stonecutter recipes)
- iron ladders (almost implemented, not climbable yet)
- stairs and slabs of the stone bricks i added
